# Browser Calculator

This is a simple javascript calculator for the browser, consciously designed for desktop first. 
Presumeably,  mobile wouldn't be the primary use case for a browser calculator, 
having native calculator apps preinstalled on most mobile devices.

Using css variables, the color scheme can be easily changed. 

The calculations base on the global Function constructor, which is a rather quick and dirty way to solve the problem, 
but considered less risky than using eval().
